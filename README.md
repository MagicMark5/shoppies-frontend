This repo contains the commit history for the beginning of the development process for the client code of the !["Shopify-frontend-challenge"](https://github.com/MagicMark5/shoppify-frontend-challenge). See that repo for the complete and updated server and client code!

The code was moved into the backend repo for hosting purposes, was renamed, and development continued in that repo from that point on.
